PyKeyboard
==========

A simple, cross-platform python module for providing keyboard control.

Caveat
------

Providing a package to handle the vast diversity of keyboards and the operating
systems that use them is a large task; there are innumerable special cases and
exceptions. This module seeks to serve as a solid foundation that should be able
to solve most problems of emulating user-keyboard interaction, and be easily
extended to solve new problems.

Todo:
-----
Add support for Windows

Add support for Mac

Add support for mobile systems?

Identify further feature requests (dynamic remapping?)

Develop keyboard monitoring for interactive keyboard discovery
